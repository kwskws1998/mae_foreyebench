  * 373: `$260` vs `$__NBWS__260.00`, `$1.7` vs `$__NBWS__1.70`, and `$1.37` vs `$__NBWS__1.37`
  * 403: `hour-long` vs `hour-long hour-long`
  * 404: `$2.9` vs `$__NBWS__2.90`
  * 425: `- many` vs `-__NBWS__many`, `against Leicester City` vs `against__NBWS__Leicester__NBWS__City`, and `van Gaal's` vs `van__NBWS__Gaal's`

## SBSAT
### Features and Adjustments
* Adjusted encoding inside of areas of interest to match statistical and machine learning models:
  * `\x92': `'`
  * `\x93`: `"`
  * `\x94`: `"`
  * `\x97`: `—`
* Matched paragraphs to areas of interest:
  * `reading-dickens-3`: Sempere & with non-breaking whitespace
  * `reading-dickens-5`: `Mr. Dickens` occupied one area of interest, split into `Mr.` and `Dickens`
  * `reading-flytrap-3`: `Burdon-Sanderson's` split across two lines lines but one area of interest defined by authors. Split into two: `Burdon-` and `Sanderson's`
  * `reading-genome-2`: `species—in` split across two lines but only one area of interest defined by authors. Split into two: `species—` and `in`.
  * `reading-genome-3`: `gee-whiz,` split across two lines but only one area of interest defined by authors. Split into two: `gee-` and `whiz,`.
  * Used OCR to get the text from the original stimuli pictures, afterwards manually corrected.  (@aarbeikop)
### Missing values
* `NEXT_SAC_DURATION` set to 0
* `start_of_line` set to 0
* `end_of_line` set to 0
